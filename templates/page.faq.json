            "answer": "<p>If you are switching from a lifetime of sleeping on an innerspring mattress to sleeping on a memory foam mattress, a break-in period where your body adjusts to the new support is common because the materials have not had time to soften and conform to your body.<\/p><p>This is why we ask people to try our memory foam bed for at least 30 days prior to going thru the return process.<\/p><p>The old mattress you’ve been sleeping on for years has adjusted to the shape and size of your body as well as your sleeping positions. After years of repeated use, materials compress and no longer adequately support your body. That indentation left by your body may cause sagging, reducing sleep quality.<\/p><p>A new pair of shoes often requires a breaking in period. The same principle applies to your new mattress; it may not feel comfortable until the materials have stretched and softened.<\/p><p>The break in period allows time for your body to adapt to your new mattress, but also for it to adjust to you. If your old sleeping surface was beginning to break down, your body might have overcompensated to make you feel comfortable. A new sleeping surface means your body may have to readjust to the support of your new mattress.These beds are built to last a life time and we designed them to be at just the perfect balance of support and comfort once they break in.This process typically takes a week.<\/p>"
